A fork of the Masterwork overhaul mod for Dwarf Fortress by Meph

Our vision for Masterfork is quite simple, evolve Dwarf Fortress into;
A World rich in flavour with meaningful decisions . This world is ancient and alive, and you are a visitor playing a small part in it.
Every feature is supposed to have meaning, no feature bloat just for the sake of features.
Ideally one civilization per race, with safeguards to allow old but stable worlds.
Tweak population numbers across the board for each civ to greatly increase world generation speeds and performance.
Thematically somewhere in the middle between J.R.R Tolkiens' Lord of the Rings and Games Workshops' Warhammer Fantasy
Optional add-on submods to alter the experience to fit the players' own playstyles
Thousands of new items. including but not limited to: weapons, armour, metals, crafting recipes
Research based progression system
Fully fleshed out and playable vanilla civilizations, with the addition of custom races.
Hundreds of new creatures
and much more..

Readme is heavy WIP

Dwarves:
Dwarves are the default race that most players will use. They have full vanilla DF content with a lot of mod additions.

Master smiths and metalworkers, they have access to three new metals and can refine their weapons and armor to masterwork quality in special forges. Metal siege-engines and javelin-throwers add new ranged capabilities, new cave-themed pets live with you underground.

Dwarves can also join military groups or guilds, receiving special training; call migrants or caravans from the liaisons office; or transmute metals in the alchemists lab.


Workshops & Furnaces
Quote

    Liaisons Office:
    Pay gold coins to request migrants or caravans to come.
    Weight Bench:
    Lift boulders to increase physical stats.
    Shrine:
    Pray for an item type. This has a very low success chance, but is a good last chance to get that missing strange-mood item.
    Wood Splitting Block:
    Basic wood-cutting workshop. Cut your tree trunks into many smaller wooden planks/blocks.
    Stonecrafter, Woodcarver, Bonecarver and Gemcutter:
    Four simple workshops that create items and furniture from there four materials that are missing in vanilla DF. Both the stonecrafter and woodcarver accept blocks as input.
    Furniture Workshop:
    Make complete sets of furniture from different materials, including some metals.
    Pottery:
    Form all kinds of items and furniture from clay, fireclay or kaolinite. These soft clay items can't be used yet, but after burning them in the kiln, you get stoneware, earthenware and porcelain items.
    Tailor:
    Create clothing and leather-armor sets with a single reaction, or unravel cloth back into thread.
    Archeologist:
    Your miners can find three unique gem-types: Relics, fossils and treasures. The archeologist can restorate them to former glory and gives you a random item... maybe a golden throne, maybe an adamantine sword... good luck!
    Alchemist:
    Requires one Orichalcum bar to build, which is a byproduct of metal working. For every 100 bars of metal made in the smelter, you get one orichalcum bar. The Alchemist can turn lead into gold, create gems and transmute metals into different metals.
    Guildhall and Garrison:
    Large buildings that enable your dwarves to change their caste. For 2500 gold they turn into a guild-member or military-group member of your choice. Guild members learn related skills twice as fast, while military-group members learn combat skills twice as fast and get a few attribute boni.
    Scriptorium:
    Write books for your library sections. Once you have 10 on any given topic, you can build a library (workshop) with it.
    Library:
    Six library sections, of warfare, mind&body, farmwork, crafting, smithing&engineering and philosophy. They instantly give any dwarf reading up on a skill a basic knowledge in it. Good for migrants and militias.
    Brick Oven:
    Make blocks of any color for awesome megaprojects.
    Ore Processor:
    Optional step before smelting your ore. Sort it into pure ore and rocks for higher yield.
    Crematory:
    Burn items and refuse to clear the fort and create ash/coke.
    Metallurgist:
    Create alloys. Attention! This means steel is made here, not in the smelter!
    Crucible:
    Smelt mithril and wolfram and efficiently make steel and bronze bars.
    Blast Furnace:
    Smelt large batches of metal ore at once. Very fuel efficient.
    Volcanic Foundry:
    Create volcanic metal, a better-than-steel alloy, warm to the touch.
    Finishing Forge:
    Cold hammer bronze, tin and copper. This allows early militias even without the need for fuel.
    Armory & Weaponry:
    Improve the quality of armors and weapons. Instead of smelting it down and reforging, simply refine the item you have. Adds one quality level per workstep, but can only be done once per item.
    Javelin Maker:
    Make ammo for your heavy crossbows, the javelin throwers. Aka mini-ballistas.
    Heavy Siegeworks:
    Create metal ballistas and catapults and batches of ammo for them.

Kobolds
Small race of thieving dog-lizard creatures as known from vanilla DF. Their theme is very much tribal, simplistic and naturalistic. They use animal materials and hunting for most of their needs; their workshops are build of wood and leather, not rock. They do not have access to picks or mining, nor to metals at all.

Due to their short lifespan of 15 years, its best to create a huge force of kobolds to outnumber your enemies. You can poison blowdarts in the kitchens or use a number of new pets to protect yourself.

Humans
Neutral traders and craftsmen. Humans thrive on the surface, building large castles, guildhalls and farms. Their main driving focus is commerce, trading produce for coin, coin for new produce... ah, good old capitalism! Guild control the market however and you need to buy your way in, establishing larger and larger guild halls to unlock more workshops.
