    [MATERIAL_VALUE:5] increased value. - zey
    [IS_STONE]
    MELTING_POINT:11818 <-- I think this is from the data collected by the contributors above and is more accurate than the numbers we're using, but we're using a high melting point until environmental lava effects are further along.

[SELECT_INORGANIC:MARBLE]
[MATERIAL_VALUE:3] increased value, marble is quite nice. - zey
