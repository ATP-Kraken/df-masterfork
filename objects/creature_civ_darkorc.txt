----------------------------------------# RACIAL SKILLS #----------------------------------------
    In MFORK skill learn rates are halved across the board, this was done for the following reasons;

     - Slow down the rapid pace at which creatures level up their skills. A dwarf shouldn't be put to train with an axe for a season and forgotten about-
        only for him to be a legendary axedwarf after just a few seasons; Characters of legendary skill should be a rare sight.
	 - Make guilds and natrual skills be more relevant and desired traits when making decisions.

	 Note: Try to refrain from giving a natural skill bonus for specific weapontypes, as my interpretation for natural skillbonuses are that they are either one or both;
	 - A.) The creature have a biological propensity for the natural bonus such as; Goblins & Kobolds are naturally slippery, justifying the Dodging NSkill.
	 - B.) The creatures' civilization have a long cultural and/or historic significance such as; all Dwarves have a basic familiarity of brewing, smithing, mining and stoneworking.
