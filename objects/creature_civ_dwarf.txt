 ----------------------------------------# RACIAL SKILLS #----------------------------------------
    In MFORK skill learn rates are halved across the board, this was done for the following reasons;

     - Slow down the rapid pace at which creatures level up their skills. A dwarf shouldn't be put to train with an axe for a season and forgotten about-
        only for him to be a legendary axedwarf after just a few seasons; Characters of legendary skill should be a rare sight.
	 - Make guilds and natrual skills be more relevant and desired traits when making decisions.

	 Note: Try to refrain from giving a natural skill bonus for specific weapontypes, as my interpretation for natural skillbonuses are that they are either one or both;
	 - A.) The creature have a biological propensity for the natural bonus such as; Goblins & Kobolds are naturally slippery, justifying the Dodging NSkill.
	 - B.) The creatures' civilization have a long cultural and/or historic significance such as; all Dwarves have a basic familiarity of brewing, smithing, mining and stoneworking.

	Many of the following tags are actually caste-level tags (in this case, male and female), but because there are no differences between the castes for these tags in a dwarf, you can add them earlier.  Any caste-level tag that occurs before castes are explicitly declared is saved up and placed on any caste that is declared later, unless the caste is explicitly derived from another caste.

	[STRANGE_MOODS]
	[INTELLIGENT]
	[TRANCES]
	[BENIGN]
	[CANOPENDOORS]
	[PREFSTRING:fine beards]

	Next we use body detail plans (which have their own raw file) to streamline the addition of some of the common materials, tissues and their relationships with each other.

	[BODY_DETAIL_PLAN:STANDARD_MATERIALS]
	[BODY_DETAIL_PLAN:STANDARD_TISSUES]
	[BODY_DETAIL_PLAN:VERTEBRATE_TISSUE_LAYERS:SKIN:FAT:MUSCLE:BONE:CARTILAGE]
	[BODY_DETAIL_PLAN:HEAD_HAIR_TISSUE_LAYERS]

	Eyebrows and eyelashes are manually added here.

	[USE_TISSUE_TEMPLATE:EYEBROW:EYEBROW_TEMPLATE]
	[TISSUE_LAYER:BY_CATEGORY:HEAD:EYEBROW:ABOVE:BY_CATEGORY:EYE]
	[USE_TISSUE_TEMPLATE:EYELASH:EYELASH_TEMPLATE]
	[TISSUE_LAYER:BY_CATEGORY:EYELID:EYELASH:FRONT]

	And nails.

	[USE_MATERIAL_TEMPLATE:NAIL:NAIL_TEMPLATE]
	[USE_TISSUE_TEMPLATE:NAIL:NAIL_TEMPLATE]
	[TISSUE_LAYER:BY_CATEGORY:FINGER:NAIL:FRONT]
	[TISSUE_LAYER:BY_CATEGORY:TOE:NAIL:FRONT]

	Set up some major arteries that couldn't be handled in the raw templates.  The selection commands can be used to grab tissue layers to adjust their properties after they have been created.

	[SELECT_TISSUE_LAYER:HEART:BY_CATEGORY:HEART]
	 [PLUS_TISSUE_LAYER:SKIN:BY_CATEGORY:THROAT]

	Then back to some more body detail plans.

	[BODY_DETAIL_PLAN:FACIAL_HAIR_TISSUES]
	[BODY_DETAIL_PLAN:STANDARD_HEAD_POSITIONS]
	[BODY_DETAIL_PLAN:HUMANOID_HEAD_POSITIONS]
	[BODY_DETAIL_PLAN:HUMANOID_RIBCAGE_POSITIONS]
	[BODY_DETAIL_PLAN:HUMANOID_RELSIZES]
	[RELSIZE:BY_CATEGORY:LIVER:300] Of course!  Standard relative size for humanoids is 200.

	Tendons and ligaments are currently very abstract, but adding these flags will let wounds occur that damage them.  The number afterward is the healing rate.  Lower is faster.

	[USE_MATERIAL_TEMPLATE:SINEW:SINEW_TEMPLATE]
	[TENDONS:LOCAL_CREATURE_MAT:SINEW:200]
	[LIGAMENTS:LOCAL_CREATURE_MAT:SINEW:200]

	This makes the creature susceptible to severed nerves when muscles are torn in limb, grasp and stance parts.

	[HAS_NERVES]

	This controls the bleeding behavior.

	[USE_MATERIAL_TEMPLATE:BLOOD:BLOOD_TEMPLATE]
	[BLOOD:LOCAL_CREATURE_MAT:BLOOD:LIQUID]

	These classes are used by syndromes (such as poison) as well as some restricted entity positions.  You can name them whatever you want.

	 [CREATURE_CLASS:GENERAL_POISON]

	Some tags to control the overall infection behavior.

	[GETS_WOUND_INFECTIONS]
	[GETS_INFECTIONS_FROM_ROT]
	[USE_MATERIAL_TEMPLATE:PUS:PUS_TEMPLATE]
	[PUS:LOCAL_CREATURE_MAT:PUS:LIQUID]

	Attributes for dwarves are still described in terms of the median value below, but the actual game effects are altered according to the raw numbers.  The numbers are different percentile values.  1000 is the human median for all attributes, so dwarven strength, for instance, has a higher median of 1250, although they suffer from their smaller size.

	These tags establish the growth phases of the creature's life.  The format is (BODY_SIZE|<year>|<day>|<average size>).

	[BODY_SIZE:0:0:4000]
	[BODY_SIZE:1:168:16000]
	[BODY_SIZE:12:0:62500] default 60000

	These body modifiers give individual dwarves different characteristics.  In the case of HEIGHT, BROADNESS and LENGTH, the modifier is also a percentage change to the BODY_SIZE of the individual creature.  The seven numbers afterward give a distribution of ranges.  Each interval has an equal chance of occurring.

	In order to set properties for body parts, first you select them.  In this case, we select all body parts of category EYE, then we add a few modifiers to them.

	Attack definitions are formatted as follows:

	[ATTACK:PUNCH:BODYPART:BY_TYPE:GRASP]
		[ATTACK_SKILL:GRASP_STRIKE]
		[ATTACK_VERB:punch:punches]

		This means that the attack will use as much of the available tissue as possible, rather than, say, thrusting with a spike.

	Here, GENERAL_BABY_NAME is at the creature level, and BABYNAME is at the caste level.  These names could be gender-specific but aren't right now.

	[BABY:1]

	[BABYNAME:dwarven baby:dwarven babies]

	This is the new format for making specific unit names for a creature.  Any unit token can be used.  If you want to add a caste-specific profession name, use CASTE_PROFESSION_NAME instead, once the caste has been declared.
