--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Design Notes:
	- A diplomacy-capable, lore-friendly playable Kobold civ.

Changes:
	- Removed LAYS_EGGS due to bugs. Kobolds are Ovoviviparous (for now)
	- Removed LOCKPICKER to allow forbidding of doors.
	- Removed FLEEQUICK to allow melee combat (some panic/go catatonic instead; see below).
	- Added INTELLIGENT to allow diplomacy/trade
	- Added BENIGN to make peaceful interactions possible.
	- Added OUTSIDER_CONTROLLABLE for independant adventurers
	- Added CAVE_ADAPT for bonuses underground, and light sensitivity
	- Adjusted LITTERSIZE to 2-4 children, born as independant toddlers.
	- Adjusted growth to reach adulthood in 1 year, with human lifespans.
	- Adjusted personalities and attributes (see below)

Aesthetics:
	- Added several cat-like details and behaviors, since they're cat-inspired.
	- Added additional eye colors ranging from orange to yellow to green.
	- Added long canine-style eye teeth, for improved bites.
	- Reskinned nails/scratching attacks as claws.
	- Added fur in several colors, which goes grey with age
	- Added cheek whiskers, and beard-like chin fur tufts for males.
	- In lieu of washing with soap, they can do cat-style self-cleaning.
	- They sweat out of their palms only, since body fur prevents sweating in animals.

Personality Adjustment:
	Tweaks made to bias them to be ambitious greedy troublemakers, to bond more quickly and show loyalty to kin, to make them messy and impulsive, to give them cripling anxiety in combat that some can resist through will, and (since they're weak on their own) to generally make them more communal and interdependent on each other.

	- Significantly raised ANXIETY_PROPENSITY to make them more likely to flee combat.
	- Significantly raised STRESS_VULNERABILITY to make them prone to going catatonic.
	- Significantly raised GREED to make them like acquiring trinkets for themselves.
	- Lowered TRUST to model general fears and anxieties.
	- Raised WASTEFULNESS to make them sloppy crafters.
	- Lowered POLITENESS to make them weird and offensive to outsiders.
	- Significantly lowered ORDERLINESS to make them leave clothes around.
	- Lowered PRIVACY to make them more interdependent and communal.
	- Significantly raised CURIOUS so they like exploring and improving skills.
	- Significantly raised TOLERANT so they can steal/integrate culture from others.
	- Raised THOUGHTLESS to make them more impulsive.
	- Raised ACTIVITY_LEVEL and EXCITEMENT_SEEKING to make them frenetic.
	- Raised ART_INCLINED to model their attraction to pretty objects.

Attribute Rebalancing:
	- Strength and Toughness raised to offset small size health/carry capacity penalties.
	- Raised Willpower to improve odds to resist panic from their naturally high anxiety.
	- Intuition raised to above-average, to model craftiness and perception.
	- Spatial Sense raised above average, to model keen senses and awareness.
	- Musicality raised to below-average, to allow languageless artistic expression.
	- Empathy raised to human average, to model languageless social perception.
	- Linguistic Ability set to abysmal. They babble, and barely manage to communicate.

	General idea is to make kobolds small, poor in social and mental skills, but with good physical skills and awareness to compensate.
