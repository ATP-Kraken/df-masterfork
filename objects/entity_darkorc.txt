[OBJECT:ENTITY]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Design notes and foreword:
	-Most of this is built on the old MDF orcs with a few additions into my own vision of what the orcs should be/are.
	-Orcs will conduct trade with civilizations, but due to their ethics may end up in conflict with many.
	-Orcs start out rather savage, survived their masters downfall hidden away in caves and deep in the forests.
	-The Orcs key goals would be to rebuild to their former glory, and survive doing so.
	-Orcs have 4 tiers of progress, with corresponding workshops and nobility.
	-Each of these tiers are gained by increasing pop for noblity, and raiding for blueprints required to build the workshops.
		-1 Forgotten Tribe
			-Low tech, stone, wood, leather bone, gemknapping,
		-2 Resurgent Tribe
			-Lowisch tech, crude slag, massfoundries, simple production of metals,
		-3 The Drums of War
			-Medium tech, vanilla DF with more choices and weapons, first magical artefacts and stuff
		-4 The Dark Horde Resurrected
			-High tech, ancient forges with highend weapons and armour, demonic sorcery and some necromancy

	-Orcs also have several castes, each suitable for different things.
		-Peon: Your basic orc, not to weak nor to strong, jack of all trades and Dwarfsized.
		-Snaga: Combined Goblin/Orc, very sneaky, good for archery, animals and hunting. Very weak and smaller than a normal gobbo.
		-Dreamwalker: Snaga sized Goblin, excellent with woundmending/doctoring and sorcery
		-Uruk: Larger than humans, very strong, never tires. Your main warmachine.
		-Olog: Even larger than The Uruk, but very bad at learning things except for blunt combat and stone/gemwork. Prone to rage.

	-Orcs also have several pets which may make them more dangerous
		-Caragors War and huntingtrainable
		-Wargs War and huntingtrainable
		-Trolls Wartrainable

		Semi-Intelligent:
			Slaves:
				-Goblin
				-Human
				-Dwarf
				-Elf
