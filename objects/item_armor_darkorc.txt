[OBJECT:ITEM]



# Each crude version is just a bit worse than the original one. Each piece has been changed to armourlevel 3 meaning that they count as plate. Since these items wont be forged anywhere other than the foundry the material size has been reduced, preventing forging in foundry->recycle for mats->repeat. In order to make the crude armours worse than their regular counterparts, each only has a coverage percentage of 90, meaning 10 percent worse than a vanilla forged helm for example. Except for these changes they should function similar to their vanilla counterparts. The shield is left as is. 20 percent block is decent enough, and slag is not a strong material anyway compared to iron->onward
